    In this challenge, youâ€™ll build a payroll toolkit using JavaScript functions to automate salary, tax, and overtime calculations. You will define reusable functions for calculating base pay (up to 40 hours), time-and-a-half overtime, and 15% tax deductions. 
    Then, you'll use those functions to process a small array of employee records and generate a full payroll report.
